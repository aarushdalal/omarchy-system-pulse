# Omarchy Plugin Marketplace Submission Guide

This document outlines the procedure to propose `omarchy-system-pulse` (`daemon0.system-pulse`) for inclusion in the official Omarchy Plugin Marketplace.

## Prerequisites

1. **Public Repository**: Ensure this repository is published publicly on GitHub under your account:
   `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/omarchy-system-pulse.git`
2. **Strict Manifest Validation**:
   Validate the plugin manifest locally against Omarchy's schema:
   ```bash
   omarchy plugin validate .
   ```
   The command must return exit code `0` with no warnings.
3. **End-to-End Installation Testing**:
   Verify complete lifecycle execution:
   ```bash
   # 1. Test installation directly from Git
   omarchy plugin add https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/omarchy-system-pulse.git --enable --yes

   # 2. Verify status and discovery
   omarchy plugin list | grep "daemon0.system-pulse"

   # 3. Test runtime disable and enable
   omarchy plugin disable daemon0.system-pulse
   omarchy plugin enable daemon0.system-pulse

   # 4. Test plugin update
   omarchy plugin update daemon0.system-pulse --yes

   # 5. Test clean removal
   omarchy plugin remove daemon0.system-pulse --yes
   ```
